local _ = require('ludash')

local people = {
	{ name = 'Robert', age = 24 },
	{ name = 'Simona', age = 29 },
	{ name = 'Jekyll', age = 26 },
	{ name = 'Aurora', age = 24 }
}

local function twentyFour (human)
	if human.age == 24 then return human end
end

local results = _.chain(people).filter(twentyFour).sortBy('name').value()

p(results)
-- will output new table:
-- { {name = 'Aurora', age = 24}, {name = 'Robert', age = 24} }
```
